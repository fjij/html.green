      <summary>Territorial Acknowledgment</summary>
      <p>
        We would like to acknowledge the sacred land on which this event will take place. Tkaronto (Toronto) has been a site of human activity for 15,000 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tkaronto is situated on land that is the traditional territory of many nations including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples. We honor the sovereignty of the Indigenous people and nations whose land we live, work and play on. The territory was the subject of the Dish With One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement between the Anishinaabek and Haudenosaunee people and allied nations to collectively share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes.
